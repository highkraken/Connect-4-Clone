# Connect-4-Clone
This is a clone version of Connect 4 game created in Python for Project Submission in classroom. The GUI for the game was created using the pygame module.

Connect Four is a two-player board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.
A player needs to play their moves by choosing the number of column and pressing the corresponding number on the numpad of keyboard in which they want their token to be dropped.

Any bug report or suggestion is greatly appreciated.
